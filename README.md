# Signal_processing_multiple_chirp_detection
#It's a part of a work for my individual research study with Professor Octav Chipara about the BeepBeep detection. Basically,
#you can use this program to detect the chirp you are looking for inside lots of noise, song, or other people's voice. 
#It's used to calculate how many times the patient cough in hospital for an hour.
#But you gonna adjust everything you want to.
#For example, everyone's voice is different, so you need to change the input
#It's a program that can make you detect any voice. But Remember:
#DON'T BE LAZY
#If you are flexible, you'll learn how to use that
#You are going to use "chirp_silence_combination". to put your chirp with the sound file
#Then you use "Correlation Detection" to find the max_correlation value
#You gonna put the chirp silence combination into the noise file with the same amount of time.
#Then you'll find the largest correlation value by running the "detect_chirp"
#It's using the correlation. So Google what is it before you use that
#Eventually, you'll have to use your own noise and other stuff to keep trying
#It will compile it right if you use it right.
#The chirp inside of the noise will have a high correlation value and the larger amplitude is, the larger correlation value
#Practice more and keep changing the variables, you'll figure it out.
